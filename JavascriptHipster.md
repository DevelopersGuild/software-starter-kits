#### Preliminary Notes 
The hipster would never touch a Windows computer for working so this 
guide is more for those running OSX and a Linux distro like Debian, Ubuntu, Elementary or PopOS
- http://ubuntu.com 
- https://elementary.io
- https://system76.com/pop
- https://www.debian.org
- https://www.apple.com/macos

### Hackable Text Editors üôÄ‚òïÔ∏è
I mean first things first we need a Hackable, Plugin Rich, Aesthetic Editor that has little 
to no visual distractions and the only way editor capable of that is https://atom.io

if you like something with a bit more functionality and some more plugins https://code.visualstudio.com
is really the only other way to go.

### Terminals
- iTerm2 üë®üèª‚Äçüíª I really like using iTerm2 because of it's additional features it's only available on OSX though 
https://www.iterm2.com

- ZSH and TMUX zsh is an amazing replacement for the traditonal bash and tmux is awesome to split terminals
into multiple sessions, screens and has some pretty neat customizations. 

- ohmyZsh has a pretty neat config file for zsh terminals https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh
- ohmyTmux https://github.com/gpakosz/.tmux has a pretty good config for tmux terminals.
 
### Package managers 
Linux already has some great package management built into it but unfortunately and fortunately 
OSX does not which is why the community developed this package manager call homebrew üç∫ https://brew.sh
it's pretty much universal in the world of development everyone knows about it. It also manages packages and
updates them for you.

### JS runtimes built on the V8 engine
This is a must for using important npm packages and building apps in serverside 
Javacript and Typescript.

### Modern UI Frameworks
React is pretty much the only framework Javascript hipsters will touch https://reactjs.org
React Native is pretty sweet for writing Mobile apps for Android and IOS https://facebook.github.io/react-native/

### Music
There's tons of playlist out there but why not support a fellow Hacker with his Spotify playlists
